# Step-by-Step-OLS-regression
This is a simple Excel file that explains thoroughly, all the steps to a Simple Linear Regression model using the OLS estimator. I employ basic excel commands for matrix multiplication and matrix inversion to derive the Î²ols = (X'X)^(-1)X'Y. The input data are not drown from anywhere and are used as an example for the better understanding of the procedure.
